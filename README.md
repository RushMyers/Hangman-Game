Description:

  For this project, I chose to make a hangman-style game.
The rules are just like hangman, except instead of a hangman
being drawn in, I chose to have stages of a tadpole morphing
into a frog, with the goal of the game being to guess the
word before the tadpole becomes a frog. The instructions are
written on the opening page, and when the user hits "New Game",
A word is randomly selected from a word bank and each letter is
represented on the screen by a blank space.  There is an alphabet
from which the user can select a letter to guess, for each letter
guessed wrong, the tadpole morphs a little more.  If the user
accumulates 6 incorrect guesses, the frog is displayed and they lose the game.
If they guess a correct letter, that letter's "spot" fills in on
the screen.  If the user completes the word, they win the game.
The user's wrong guesses left, games won, and games lost are displayed
on the screen.

Technologies Used:

Languages: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery
Planning: Trello
Text editor: Sublime Text 3

Features:

- Images that change representing the user's wrong guesses
- Scorekeeper that shows a player's games won, games lost, and
  how many wrong guesses they have left before they lose the game

Future Development:
-fix bugs: prevent user from being able to click a ltter that they've
          already guessed.
           fix "new game" bug - right now if user hits "new game" during
           a current game, a new answer is added on top of old answer.
